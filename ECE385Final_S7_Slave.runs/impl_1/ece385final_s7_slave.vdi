Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'bd_inst/clk_wiz_1/clk_in1' is not directly connected to top level port. Synthesis is ignored for IBUF_LOW_PWR but preserved for implementation.

 2) Xilinx IP that contains XPM_CDC modules: Verify the connections to the IP to determine whether you can safely ignore this message.
